 * in java interface is a group of related

 * 
 * to implement the interface we use implements keyword
 * 
 * we cannot make an object of interface but we can make a referance of it
 * 
 * in abstract class there can be some non abstract methods but in interface there is all
 * abstract methods
 * 
 * we cant extend multiple abstract classes to make a single class,, but 
 * we can implement multiple interfaces at a time to make a single class 
 *  ,,, similer like a multiple inharitance
