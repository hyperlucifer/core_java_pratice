/*
 * Hashing is scearching technique that useses the key value pair for 
 * for storing the elements
 * 
 * the hash funcation is f(x)=x%10 ,,here the 10 is the size of the array x is the element and f(x)
 * is the index==it means store the element at the index comming  
 * 
 * this makes the scearching very fast
 * 
 * if the index value comes same for the two elements (this is called hash collision)
 * then it will store the one element and 
 * another element will be store at the next empty space in the array,,,this is open addressing
 * technique to handel the collision
 * 
 * in chaning technique if two or more elements has the same index then make a linked list 
 * of both the elements and point it to that index
