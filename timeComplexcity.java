 * Time Complexity=time taken by an algorithem as a funcation of the length of input.
 *                =it is used to compare two algorithem to see which one is better
 *                =it checks the time taken by a funcation to run
 * 
 * while soling the problem ignore the smaller value and all the consentents
 * eg
 * 1)y(n)=3n^2+5n = O(n^2) ------>here n is the constant and 5 is the smaller value therefore we have 
 *                                ignore both and consider 3 as n
