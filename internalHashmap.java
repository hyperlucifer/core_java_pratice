 * in hashmap everything is stored in key value pair
 * key is always a unque in every map there is no two similer key in a set
 * in map insert,scerch and delete take O(1);
 * it store the value in ramdom memory location
 * 
 * hashing is a concept in which we can convert big object or strings in a small
 * in finite amount of value
 * 
 * for same input same output will be generated but for different input same output can be generated
 * 
 * hash funcations
 * 
 * 1)map larger values to smaller values
 * 2)should be in O(1) or O(len) for string keys
 * 3)Should uniformly distribute large keys into hash table slots
